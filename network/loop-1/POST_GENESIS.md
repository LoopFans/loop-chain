* Replace your genesis with the public one found in this repo
* Find peers and seeds here.
* Update your minimum-gas-prices in the app.toml
* Start the node and sync up

Following these instructions, your validator will be put into a queue for the chain admins to accept or reject. Once accepted, you will be a validator on the network.
The chain admin's will set your amount if they accept.
